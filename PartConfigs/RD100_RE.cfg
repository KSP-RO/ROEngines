	@description = The RD-100 engine series were the first large scale Ethalox Russian liquid propellant rocket engines ever developed and fired. The original RD-100 engine was a 1:1 copy of the German Model 39 engine (used on the A-4 ballistic missile), with later variants (RD-101 and RD-103/M) featuring ever increasing performance to satisfy the needs of the larger R-2 and R-5 IRBMs. Diameter: 1.65 m.
