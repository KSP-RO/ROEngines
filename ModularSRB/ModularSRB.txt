CALCULATIONS
=============================================
Cases
	* Design Safety Factor (DSF)
		* Varies from 1.1 (uncrewed) to 1.5 (crewed)
	* MEOP = Maximum Expected Operating Pressure
	* Design Assumptions
		a) Failure criterion is defined as ultimate tensile failure
		b) Ultimate tensile strength of the material is 
	* Case Thickness
		t = ((P*D) / (2 * S * e - P)) + C

		t = case thickness
		P = Max allowable working pressure (psi)
		D = inside Diameter (in)
		S = Max Allowable Tensile Stress (psi)
		e = efficiency of welded joint
		C = corrosion allowance
	* Case Mass
		t * pi * D * L * p + (pi / 4) * t * D^2 * p

		t	= case thickness
		pi	= 3.14159265359
		D	= Diameter
		L	= Length
		p	= Material Density
	* MAWP (Maximum Allowable Working Pressure)
		P = (TS * t * E) / (R * SF)
		
		P = MAWP
		TS = Tensile Strength (psi)
		t = case thickness (in)
		E = Efficiency of Weld
		R = Interior Radius of Vessel (in)
		SF = Safety Factor



TYPES
==========================================================
* Segmented
	* minDiameter = 2.0
	* maxDiameter = 10.0
	* segmentLength = 1.0 (1.0, 5.0)
	* numSegments = 1.0 (1.0, 10.0)
	* nozzleDiameter = 
* Smooth
	* minDiameter = 0.5
	* maxDiameter = 10.0
	* caseLength = 4.0 (2.0, 50.0)
* Upper Stage
	* minDiameter = 0.15
	* maxDiameter = 3.0
	* caseLength = 1.0 (0.5, 10.0)
* Separator
	* minDiameter = 0.05
	* maxDiameter = 0.5
	* caseLength = 0.75 (0.1, 4.0)




NOZZLES
* Vacuum
* Angled

* 1.04m Nozzle Throat is the maximum practical size for a 3.05m SRB




ATTITUDE CONTROL
* Gimbal Thrust Vector Control
	* Shuttle SRB had this, Hydrazine power units that moved actuators for gimbal control
	* Provides Pitch & Yaw (need 2 for Roll Control)
	* Shuttle SRB
		* Hydraulic Power Units x 2
			* 22 lb of Hydrazine
* Liquid Injection TVC
	* TITAN used a Hydrazine Liquid Injection
* Hypergolic RCS Thrusters
	* Peacekeeper Missiles
	* Ares




CASES
* Steel
* Graphite Epoxy
	* Shuttle SRB casing
		* Steel Weight = 44,500 kg
			* Insulation of 20,500 lbs
		* GEM = 31,300 kg
* Fiberglass
* Titanium
	* Compare STAR 26 and STAR 26B for the mass differences

	
	

PROPELLANT
* HTPB
	* Castor IV -> Castor IVA was a 10% improvement due to HTPB alone
